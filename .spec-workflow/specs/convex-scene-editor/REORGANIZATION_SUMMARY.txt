TASK REORGANIZATION SUMMARY
===========================

The tasks.md file has been reorganized to group related functionality together
and improve the logical flow of implementation.

NEW TASK ORDER:
---------------

Tasks 1-2: Convex2 Class (unchanged)
  1. Implement Convex2 class basic structure
  2. Implement Convex2 raycast methods

Tasks 3-4: Scene Management (moved from old 7-8)
  3. Implement random convex generation (was task 7)
  4. Implement scene initialization and management (was task 8)

Tasks 5-8: User Interaction (moved from old 11-14)
  5. Implement object hover detection and highlighting (was task 11)
  6. Implement object dragging with sticky focus (was task 12)
  7. Implement object rotation and scaling (was task 13)
  8. Implement scene control keyboard shortcuts (was task 14)

Tasks 9-11: Rendering (moved from old 15-17)
  9. Implement basic convex rendering with two modes (was task 15)
  10. Implement debug visualization modes (was task 16)
  11. Implement visible raycast rendering (was task 17)

Tasks 12-15: Spatial Structures (moved from old 3-6)
  12. Implement AABB2Tree (BVH) tree building (was task 3)
  13. Implement AABB2Tree ray query (was task 4)
  14. Implement SymmetricQuadTree tree building (was task 5)
  15. Implement SymmetricQuadTree ray query with deduplication (was task 6)

Tasks 16-17: Performance Testing (moved from old 9-10)
  16. Implement batch raycast performance testing (was task 9)
  17. Implement performance metrics UI display (was task 10)

Tasks 18-20: Integration and Finalization (unchanged)
  18. Full system integration and testing
  19. Performance optimization and profiling
  20. Final testing, documentation, and submission

REFERENCE UPDATES:
------------------

All task references in _Leverage and _Prompt fields have been updated:
- Task 4 now references "task 12-13" and "task 14-15" (spatial structures)
- Task 6 now references "task 4" (RebuildAllTrees)
- Task 8 now references "task 3", "task 4", and "task 16"
- Task 13 now references "task 12" (tree structure)
- Task 17 now references "task 16" (timing results)
- Task 20 now references "task 16" (performance measurements)

SPECIAL NOTES:
--------------

Task 16 (Performance testing) includes a NOTE:
"Spatial structure testing (QuadTree and BVH modes) will be fully functional 
after tasks 12-15 are complete"

This clarifies that while the performance testing can be implemented earlier,
the spatial structure modes will only work after the BVH and QuadTree tasks
are completed.

RATIONALE:
----------

The new order groups related functionality together:
1. Core data structures first (Convex2)
2. Scene setup and management
3. User interaction features
4. Rendering and visualization
5. Spatial optimization structures
6. Performance analysis
7. Integration and finalization

This allows for more logical development flow where basic features are
implemented before advanced optimizations.
