This educational tool demonstrates spatial optimization techniques (BVH, QuadTree) and provides real-time performance metrics for comparing different raycast optimization strategies. The application allows users to manipulate convex shapes, perform batch raycasting tests, and analyze performance characteristics across different object counts and optimization modes.\r\n\r\n## Alignment with Product Vision\r\n\r\nThis project serves as a practical implementation of computational geometry concepts, specifically:\r\n- Convex hull representation and manipulation\r\n- Ray-convex intersection algorithms\r\n- Spatial partitioning optimization techniques (BVH, QuadTree)\r\n- Performance analysis and algorithmic complexity observation\r\n\r\nThe tool provides hands-on experience with game engine architecture patterns and real-time rendering systems.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n### REQ-1: Project Setup (3 points)\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a new project cloned from Protogame2D called ConvexSceneEditor, so that I have a working foundation for the assignment.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN the project is created THEN it SHALL be named \"ConvexSceneEditor\"\r\n2. WHEN the project is created THEN it SHALL be cloned from the Protogame2D template\r\n3. WHEN the project builds THEN it SHALL compile without errors in Debug and Release configurations\r\n4. WHEN the project runs THEN it SHALL display a window with the game engine initialized\r\n\r\n### REQ-2: Random Convex Scene Generation (10 points)\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a scene with N=8 randomly generated static convex polygons, so that I can test raycast algorithms against varied geometric configurations.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display N=8 random static (non-moving) convex objects\r\n2. WHEN a convex polygon is generated THEN it SHALL have between 3-8 vertices\r\n3. WHEN vertices are generated THEN they SHALL form a valid convex polygon (CCW winding order)\r\n4. WHEN polygons are displayed THEN they SHALL fit within the world bounds\r\n5. WHEN polygons are generated THEN each SHALL have a unique random position, size, and rotation\r\n6. WHEN the scene is rendered THEN all convex objects SHALL be visible and non-overlapping (or overlapping is acceptable)\r\n\r\n### REQ-3: Dual Rendering Modes (5 points)\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle between two different rendering modes with F2, so that I can visualize how overlapping convex shapes create composite concave appearances.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN the user presses F2 (or similar key) THEN the system SHALL toggle between Mode A and Mode B\r\n2. WHEN Mode A is active THEN objects SHALL be drawn with translucent fill and thick opaque edges\r\n3. WHEN Mode B is active (default) THEN all object edges SHALL be drawn first (thick, opaque, dark)\r\n4. WHEN Mode B is active THEN all object interiors SHALL be drawn second (opaque, light)\r\n5. WHEN Mode B is active AND objects overlap THEN the system SHALL create the appearance of a composite concave shape(s)\r\n\r\n### REQ-4: Visible Raycast Visualization (12 points)\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to see one visible raycast with its impact point and surface normal, so that I can understand how ray-convex intersection works visually.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN the scene is rendered THEN the system SHALL display one visible raycast\r\n2. WHEN the raycast is drawn THEN it SHALL show the ray line\r\n3. WHEN the raycast hits an object THEN it SHALL show the impact position\r\n4. WHEN the raycast hits an object THEN it SHALL show the surface normal drawn nicely using 2D arrows\r\n5. WHEN the raycast misses all objects THEN it SHALL still be visible as a ray line\r\n\r\n### REQ-5: Batch Raycast Performance Testing (15 points)\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to fire M=1024 invisible random raycasts when I press 'T' and see the elapsed time, so that I can measure raycast performance.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN the user hits the 'T' key THEN M=1024 invisible random raycasts SHALL fire\r\n2. WHEN raycasts fire THEN each SHALL be from a random position in the scene to another random position within the scene\r\n3. WHEN batch raycasting starts THEN the current time SHALL be measured immediately before the loop\r\n4. WHEN batch raycasting completes THEN the current time SHALL be measured immediately after the loop\r\n5. WHEN timing is complete THEN the elapsed time SHALL be displayed on the screen afterwards\r\n6. WHEN raycasts are generated THEN they SHALL all be invisible (not drawn)\r\n\r\n### REQ-6: Debug Visualization for Single Object (6 points)\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see convex hull planes and ray test points when only 1 object exists, so that I can debug the ray-convex intersection algorithm.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN only 1 object is present THEN the system SHALL draw convex hull planes\r\n2. WHEN only 1 object is present THEN the system SHALL draw ray intercept points\r\n3. WHEN only 1 object is present THEN the system SHALL draw ray test points\r\n4. WHEN debug visualization is shown THEN elements SHALL be color-coded by status/rejection\r\n5. WHEN multiple objects exist THEN this debug visualization SHALL NOT be shown\r\n\r\n### REQ-7: Mouse Hover Detection (5 points)\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to see which convex object my mouse is hovering over highlighted as the \"current\" object, so that I can identify shapes for interaction.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN the mouse position is inside a convex object THEN that object SHALL be highlighted\r\n2. WHEN the mouse position is inside multiple overlapping objects THEN at most one object SHALL be highlighted as the \"current\" object\r\n3. WHEN an object is highlighted THEN it SHALL be visually distinct from non-highlighted objects\r\n4. WHEN the mouse moves outside all objects THEN no object SHALL be highlighted\r\n\r\n### REQ-8: Sticky Hover Behavior (4 points)\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a user, I want the highlighted object to remain locked while hovering, so that I can reliably interact with the same object.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN an object is highlighted THEN the highlight SHALL never change to another object\r\n2. WHEN an object is highlighted THEN the system SHALL always keep the current object highlighted\r\n3. WHEN the mouse moves outside the current object THEN the highlight SHALL be cleared\r\n4. WHEN the mouse re-enters the scene THEN a new object MAY be highlighted\r\n\r\n### REQ-9: Spatial Partitioning Implementation (12 points)\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement at least one spatial hashing/partitioning scheme, so that I can optimize raycast performance for scenes with many objects.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN the system is implemented THEN it SHALL include at least one spatial hashing and/or partitioning scheme\r\n2. WHEN choosing a scheme THEN it MAY be BSP, BVH, bit-buckets, or another spatial optimization technique\r\n3. WHEN the spatial structure is built THEN it SHALL correctly partition the scene objects\r\n4. WHEN raycasts are performed THEN the spatial structure SHALL be used to accelerate queries\r\n5.
